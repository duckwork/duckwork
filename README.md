# duckwork is acdw is duckwork

hi there.
my name is Case.
i'm known also as
[acdw](https://www.acdw.net/),
[@acdw](https://writing.exchange/@acdw),
[~acdw](https://tilde.town/~acdw),
[~breadw](https://breadpunk.club/~acdw),
and of course, duckwork.

i actually don't do much development on github any more.
you can find my good stuff on
~[sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~acdw)~
<https://git.acdw.net>.
i currently work on stuff in bash for the smol internet,
including
[bollux](https://sr.ht/~acdw/bollux/), a browser for the
[gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/)
protocol;
[unk](https://sr.ht/~acdw/unk/), 
a teeny tiny static site generator;
and
[mrgrctrnl](https://sr.ht/~acdw/mrgrctrnl/),
a magic ssh tunneler thing.

uhhh i'm pretty sure github *requires* emojis on readmes now, so here:
🔥🌭🍞😂🐌🐔🎩🎳😤

NOTE 2024-08-23: I really don't use this account at all any more. 
Github's shady dealings and Copilot BS mean I'm not going to work with them unless I have to
(for other people's code or reporting issues).
If you want to see me, find me at acdw.net.

(PS. I considered deleting all my repos but GH already has em yoinked, so they're just staying up.)
