# duckwork is acdw is duckwork

hi there.
my name is Case.
i'm known also as
[acdw](https://www.acdw.net/),
[@acdw](https://writing.exchange/@acdw),
[~acdw](https://tilde.town/~acdw),
[~breadw](https://breadpunk.club/~acdw),
and of course, duckwork.

i actually don't do much development on github any more.
you can find my good stuff on
[sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~acdw).
i currently work on stuff in bash for the smol internet,
including
[bollux](https://sr.ht/~acdw/bollux/), a browser for the
[gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/)
protocol;
[unk](https://sr.ht/~acdw/unk/), 
a teeny tiny static site generator;
and
[mrgrctrnl](https://sr.ht/~acdw/mrgrctrnl/),
a magic ssh tunneler thing.

uhhh i'm pretty sure github *requires* emojis on readmes now, so here:
